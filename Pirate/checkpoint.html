            <h2>Christopher Wilkinson Game Logic Progress:</h2>
            <hr>
            <h2>I believe I am about 75% of the way done with the game logic</h2>
            <hr>
            <h2>Make a Two player game selectable and generate a game for two players: Not Yet implemented</h2>        
            <h2>Make a Four player game selectable and generate a game for four players: Implemented</h2>
            <p>To test, reload the page and it should take you to the 2/4 player game selection</p>
            <h2>Use a random function to deterine what team will go first and has nine cards as well: Implemented</h2>
            <p>To test, restart the game from scratch or click all of the tiles so they are all visiable (there will be three alerts of winning blue, winning green, and game over for black. Once all are clicked you can just input "newGame()" into the console as many times as you want and it will make a new game grid.)</p>
            <h2>Make a function to randomly assign 25 unique words to the 25 game tiles: Implemented</h2>
            <p>To test, restart the game from scratch or click all of the tiles so they are all visiable (there will be three alerts of winning blue, winning green, and game over for black. Once all are clicked you can just input "newGame()" into the console as many times as you want and it will make a new game grid.)</p>
            <h2>Randomly assign the 9 and 8 blue and green cards, as well as the 7 tan, and 1 black card: Implemented</h2>
            <p>To test, restart the game from scratch or click all of the tiles so they are all visiable (there will be three alerts of winning blue, winning green, and game over for black. Once all are clicked you can just input "newGame()" into the console as many times as you want and it will make a new game grid.)</p>
            <h2>Make the cards clickable: Implemented</h2>
            <p>To test, For the assignmnt 4 example you will have to reset the game by refreshing and once you put the four names in the cards will be clickable</p>
            <h2>Make score counters that have the correct starting card values and incremently decrease when a card is guessed: Implemented</h2>
            <p>To test, Click on a card and watch the number</p>
            <h2>Have the four players enter their name to identify if it is their turn: Implemented</h2>
            <p>To test, Refresh the page, once all four are added they should be displayed on the sides of the table in the respective teams</p>
            <h2>Start a new round button: Not Yet implemented</h2>
            
            <h2>Add a place for the captain players to input clues that the first mate players will use.: Barely Implemented needs work</h2>
            <p>To test, when you click on the fisnish turn and a captains name appears in the current player box, then you will be able to submit a clue.</p>
            
            <h2>Make a banner to tell the user what turn it is.: Implemented</h2>
            <p>To test, You can look at the bottom and it should have the background color of the team and the name of the player</p>
            <h2>Make a Finish Turn/ next turn button: Implemented</h2>
            <p>To test, This changes the current player to the next player and normally shows the backs of the cards for the captain roles, but I have disabled that to meet the requirements of project 4</p>
            <h2>Clue Logs: Barely Implemented</h2>
            <p>To test, If you enter a clue on the captains turn it should enter into the respective log, but there is still a lot of work to do.</p>
