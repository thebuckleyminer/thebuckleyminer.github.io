                <h2>Documentation of how my games satisfies the requirements</h2>
                <h3>20	Game grid that uses CSS and is generated by JavaScript</h3>
                The game grid is generated in JavaScript. It chooses unique words and color for every card.
                With CSS the word placement on the card takes place.

                <h3>20	User input in the form of text, select options, and/or buttons</h3>
                The four players have a text entry box to input their names, as well as a button to select their role, there is also finish turn buttons, a clue text input, a number list dropdown to choose quantity and more!

                <h3>20	User input in the form of mouse clicks</h3>
                When a card is clicked it changes the card from the front side to the back side.

                <h3>20	Dynamic modification of HTML using innerHTML or DOM functions</h3>
                The whole game grid is generated, as well as the pre-game tutorial menus, and name selection menus. The main part of the dynamic modification though is the score, found player, and players turn parts of the game page that change as the game progresses.

                <h3>20 Use of XMLHttpRequest to load JSON or XML game data that is displayed on the grid Page</h3>
                The JSON File I have chosen to include for this project contains the word list which is an array that holds the card words. I also have in the JSON the first name list and last name list.
                <h3>20 Incorporates HTML 5 audio tags, video tags, canvas, or local storage</h3>
                For this requirement I added an audio file on the Game Grid page. This audio file is the only source not personally created for this semester project besides the three fonts I have used.
                The audio track is called: "♩♫ Epic Pirate Music ♪♬ - Pirate Crew (Copyright and Royalty Free)" and can be found at <a href="https://youtu.be/hVBgKCYrI-c">https://youtu.be/hVBgKCYrI-c</a>
                The audio will auto load and loop.



                <h3>120	Game logic code</h3>
                In this four player game, the main game logic parts include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Dynamic name input for all four players.</li>
                    <li>Generated tiles.</li>
                    <li>The starting team has 9 cards and the other team has 8.</li>
                    <li>The scores update when a card is chosen.</li>
                    <li>There are two player modes, one that gives a clue, and one that guesses.</li>
                    <li>There are two teams, so four player roles total.</li>
                    <li>There is a next player button on a screen that hides the cards so other players are not revealed the cards.</li>
                    <li>The Captain's clue is displayed on the page.</li>
                    <li>When a player clicks on a card it reveals the back side.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>20	Extra Credit Include a second HTML5 component. If your first HTML5 component is media (audio or video) then your second component can't be a media component.</h3>
                For this requirement I implemented the HTML 5 local storage for the purposes if the players want to play another game. This works by storing their names and a restart value to local storage.
                When the game is now rebooted the game bypasses the tutorial and player name sections stright to a freshly generated board.
                The local storage is then cleared immediatly after loaded, so when the game is refreshed or is opened at a later date it will start fresh and not load in this manner.
                Thus the restart game only works when the restart game button is pressed.

                250	TOTAL

                *HINT* - As a bonus "Easter EGG" The images on the tutorial page do different animations when they are hovered over. :)
