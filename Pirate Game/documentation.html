                <h2>Documentation of how my game satisfies the requirements</h2>
                <h3>20	Game grid that uses CSS and is generated by JavaScript</h3>
                JavaScript generates the game board by choosing unique words, cards, and colors for every game tile location, so every board is spectacularly unique.
                CSS is used to place my handmade cards on the board in the front, back, and flipped states.
                CSS is also used for the word placement on the front and back of the cards both in their normal and 90&deg placements.

                <h3>20	User input in the form of text, select options, and/or buttons</h3>
                I have made great use of these elements.
                The game starts off with an optional tutorial where you navigate through by clicking a next button.
                Because this is a four player game each of four players have a text entry box to input their names to keep track of turns.
                There are four buttons to select roles, and after one is taken it dissapears until none are left.
                There is a popup screen because this is a battleship like game it is important that the other players can not see certain aspects when it is not their turn. There is a button to start a turn which goes back to the game grid for the certain players view.
                In the top right corner on the Game Grid page is where the button is located to either finish the turn, submit the clue and finish turn, or play the game again once the game has ended. 
                Lastly the Captain Role players give clues to the players. This element of gameplay includes both a text box for entering a clue as well as a select menu for choosing the number of cards that clue is applicable to.


                <h3>20	User input in the form of mouse clicks</h3>
                The primary use of mouse clicks and event listeners in my program is for the player to select a recruit card.
                When a recruit card is clicked it the game logic transforms the recruit card from the front side to the back side.
                Only First Mates can can click cards on their turn, and they can only click up to one more than the Captain's Command will allow.
                Or the game will immediatly end if the Black recruit card is selected, or their turn will end if a recruit card not of their crew color is selected.
                I have also used many mouse clicks and event listeners for all of the buttons.

                <h3>20	Dynamic modification of HTML using innerHTML or DOM functions</h3>
                The whole game grid is generated in JavaScript and then is inserted using innerHTML.
                The pre-game tutorial menus, name selection menus, and inbetween turn display make use of innerHTML and DOM functions.
                The most escential aspect of the dynamic modification though is the dynamic gameplay aspects of the Score(cards remaining), Found Pirate List, Current Player name, role, and color, as well as many other parts that change as the game progresses such as the cards.

                <h3>20 Use of XMLHttpRequest to load JSON or XML game data that is displayed on the grid Page</h3>
                To satisfy this requirement I have created a JSON File that contains my "wordList" of the bank of words that may be on the cards as well as the first and last name lists used for the Found Pirate Log on the game page.

                <h3>20 Incorporates HTML 5 audio tags, video tags, canvas, or local storage</h3>
                To satisfy this requirement I have added an audio file on the Game Grid page. This audio file is the only source not personally created for this semester project besides the three fonts I have used.
                The audio track titled: "♩♫ Epic Pirate Music ♪♬ - Pirate Crew (Copyright and Royalty Free)" and can be found at (https://youtu.be/hVBgKCYrI-c).
                The audio is set auto load and loop. I converted this from a wav file to mp3 as well so it should be more universally compatiable with all modern browsers.


                <h3>120	Game logic code</h3>
                Some of the swashbuckling Game Logic in this high seas four player game include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Dynamic name input for all four players.</li>
                    <li>Once names have been saved with the role, the player role sticks with the player for the rest of the game and they will have unique tasks from their other team member.</li>
                    <li>The starting team has 9 cards and the other team has 8. This is randomly generated and then assigned to a team.</li>
                    <li>The Game Recruit Cards are generated randomly containing a unique word (pirate nickname) as well as assigned one of four colors as well as a pirate picture</li>
                    <li>Counting down the scores update when a card is chosen.</li>
                    <li>The game swiches between two player modes, for each of the two teams. One player, the Captain role gives a clue, and the First Mate guesses with the help of the Captain's clue.</li>
                    <li>In between turns a next player button appears on the screen that hides the game board so the other players can not accidently cheat.</li>
                    <li>After the Captain submites a clue, the clue is displayed on the First Mate's game page.</li>
                    <li>If a First Mate makes a legal gameplay move and clicks on a card, that card will be flipped and the back side will be revealed to all four players for the remainder of the game.</li>
                    <li>If a Pirate is from either the Blue or Green crew, the Pirate's full name will be displayed on the side in the Found Pirate Log.</li>
                    <li>+ more.

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>20	Extra Credit Include a second HTML5 component. If your first HTML5 component is media (audio or video) then your second component can't be a media component.</h3>
                For this requirement I implemented the HTML 5 local storage for the purposes if the players want to play another game. This works by storing their names and a restart value to local storage.
                When the game is now rebooted the game bypasses the tutorial and player name sections stright to a freshly generated board.
                The local storage is then cleared immediatly after loaded, so when the game is refreshed or is opened at a later date it will start fresh and not load in this manner.
                Thus the restart game only works when the restart game button is pressed.
