                <h2 class="classCenter font1">Yer in need of a Crew and have come to the right place!</h2>
                <p>In this Crew Building four player game each player has a different role! Split into two teams, each team has one Captain who will oversee the operation, and a First Mate who will do the heavy lifting of getting new recuits.</p>
                <p>The board consists of 25 cards. Each card has a Pirate nickname on it and it is your team's objective to collect your whole crew first. </p>
                <p>Each team has eight or nine recruit cards that correspond to their crew's color.</p>
                <p>There is one Black card that that is chosen is an instant game over, and the remaining are neutral.</p>
                <p>The Captain has the ability to see the bottom colored side of the cards and must give the First Mate a one or two word clue for what pirates to recruit.</p>
                <p>The First Mate can only see the Tan side of the recuit cards and must make a guess to what the Captain was thinking.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This game is similar to a reverse battleship senario where you are trying to blindly guide your team to the card you want them to!</p>
                
                <br>
                <p>-This game is heavily based off of Codenames. I do not intend to make this public outside the scope of this class, nor do I strive to make any money off of it.</p>
